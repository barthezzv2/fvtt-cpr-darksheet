Dark sheets for Cyberpunk RED Core (https://gitlab.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core)

Works best with Ernie's Modern UI (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ernies-modern-layout), choose the Alien or Cyberpunk Preset for best results.

Place the file in your Cyberpunk RED module location, you will need to do that everytime you update the module.

"Installation":
- Go to your foundry install folder
- Browse into {foundry path}/Data/systems/cyberpunk-red-core/
- Rename the old main.css file to main.css.old (incase you want to revert back)
- Create a new txt file (which will be renamed to .css instead of .txt).
- Edit the new main.css (or main.txt if you didnt change the extension yet) with with a text editor (notepad/nano/sublime...etc)
- Paste the main.css content provided into it and save.
- Refresh foundry and you should see the changes.


Works as of Foundry VTT V10 Build 291 && Cyberpunk RED Core v0.85.2.
Updated for v0.86.1.
